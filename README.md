# AutoCertiGen: Revolutionizing the Automation of Electronic Batch Certificate Generation using Apache Libraries
The production of digital documents such as certificates for various individuals has
been an arduous problem for every organization, particularly educational
institutions with thousands of students enrolled and wherein it is required to issue
certificates to hundreds of them on a regular basis. We live in a modern era of
technology where individually entering candidate information and then certifying
the documents is not a realistic choice and hence, we automated this crucial and
time taking process, by proposing and building an offline Android application
named 'AutoCertiGen' that has the potential to generate thousands of certificates in
a matter of minutes, complete with signatures if needed. The application is
lightweight and does not require internet connectivity for operation. It addresses
the problem at hand with just a few taps on a touchscreen.
